      <p class="customize-text">
        At Flip Stitch Pillows, we believe in more than just a collection of
        feathers. Our pillows are artisan handcrafted in our Pittsburgh-based factory
        where we perform extra measures to ensure an unmatched quality is kept.
      </p> 
      <br/>
      <p class="callout-text center-align">A Quality Unlike Any Other</p>
      <p class="customize-text">
        When we say our pillows are artisan-made, we don't mean that lightly. Our
        comfort engineers are trained to ensure the stitching on each pillow is
        crafted to perfection. Being in the business for over sixty years, we know
        a good pillow when we see one. When you purchase a Flip Stitch Pillow, you
        are investing in the future of your home, apartment, office, or wherever you
        wish to decorate. You expect a pillow that makes a statement and will last for
        years to come. Flip Stitch pillows exceed those standards.
      </p>

      <p class="callout-text center-align">Our First Stitch</p>
      <p class="customize-text">
        Flip Stitch Pillows was founded in 1954 upon the idea that a pillow represents
        so much more than just comfort: it represents family, safety, style. The Flip
        family began creating pillows from their basement knowing the value pillows
        meant to them. They sold pillows on street corners and bus stops, barely
        scraping by after quitting jobs at the local steel mill. The Flips then
        were able to expand, purchasing a factory near the Strip district of
        Pittsburgh and have been distributing from there ever since.
